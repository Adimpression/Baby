== Hello Down Town'er! ==

=== Very Very Very Very Private Socializing On Down Town ===

''DT is a social network hysterically focused on privacy.''

If you want only your family to see an event(called Moments) on DT, you can do it.

If it's just friends the secrets of that moment are safe with, you can make that happen.

'''It's very very very very very private!'''

=== Down Town knows socializing is best done offline ===

DT wants you to use the website as less as possible.

Compare that with other social networks who are hungry to keep you online to click their ads.

DT just wants you to find ways to socialize in real life.

Once you've done that, you just head out and have fun with your friends and family.

Yes you can come back to discuss stuff before and after the event.

But mostly, Down Town makes a maximum effort to chase you out to socialize.

This is why updates can be '''autoplayed'''.

If a friend updates a photo or moment talk, you are automatically send there unless you '''pause''' the autoupdate.

See? We want you to get moving fast.

''What's more fabulous than a social network that autoplays in front of your eyes, the latest updates!''
