==== 0.2) How may we serve you? ====
* 0.2.1) Can we interest you in finding out what interesting places to visit, given any location on earth?
If so, head over to [http://www.ilikeplaces.com www.iLikePlaces.com] and search for any location on Earth.
You'll see a map with makers of interesting places in that area. Now, go visit them! Tell a friend!
* 0.2.2) Can we interest you in finding out, given any moment, the most interesting place to be?
We wish we could! Well, we have that bad habbit of pursuing our wishes '''With All We've Got'''. Stay tuned!
* 0.2.3) Can we interest you in planning out private events with close friends and family?
No, if you click "like", things aren't going to be all public exposing you to a lot of embarrassment.
Instead, head over to [http://www.ilikeplaces.com www.iLikePlaces.com] and '''Start a Moment'''.
Once you've done that, invite your friends and family to it.
'''Now you've got your own private moment'''. It's got a '''Talk Page''' to discuss your event stuff.
Hey, you can upload photos too!
* 0.2.4) Can we interest you in starting a movement on something you believe in something very badly?
Start a Tribe! Ah you guessed it right. You just have to visit  [http://www.ilikeplaces.com www.iLikePlaces.com].

There you go. That much we can offer you. Tell a friend!

==== 3.1) Very Very Very Very Private Socializing On Down Town ====
'''DT is a social network hysterically focused on privacy.'''
If you want only your family to see an event(called Moments) on DT, you can do it.
If it's just friends the secrets of that moment are safe with, you can make that happen.
'''It's very very very very very private!'''
==== 3.1) Down Town knows socializing is best done offline ====
DT wants you to use the website as less as possible.
Compare that with other social networks who are hungry to keep you online to click their ads.
DT just wants you to find ways to socialize in real life.
Once you've done that, you just head out and have fun with your friends and family.
Yes you can come back to discuss stuff before and after the event.
But mostly, Down Town makes a maximum effort to chase you out to socialize.
This is why updates can be '''autoplayed'''.
If a friend updates a photo or moment talk, you are automatically send there unless you '''pause''' the autoupdate.
See? We want you to get moving fast.
'''What's more fabulous than a social network that autoplays in front of your eyes, the latest updates!'''
==== 3.3) So What Is Down Town? ====
'''You tell us the time, even if its "now" and we'll tell you the most exciting place to be!'''
