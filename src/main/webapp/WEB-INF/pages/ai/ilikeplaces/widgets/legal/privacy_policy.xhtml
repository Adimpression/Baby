<p class="intensity_2">
    Below is the Privacy Policy of iLikePlaces.com. Please read it carefully. It is written as simple as possible so
    that
    you actually READ it.
</p>


<ul class="intensity_2">
<li style="list-style-type:none;">What the privacy policy is for
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><p>This Privacy Policy is to assist you in understanding how this site collects, uses and safeguards your
            information provided to this site and to assist you in making informed decisions when using this site.

<li style="list-style-type:none;">Introduction
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><p>Adimpression is an innovative advertising company. It strictly, deviates
            from traditional spammers.
            Spamming is, overload of advertisements, whether relevant or irrelevant. When you see an advertisement not
            relevant to what is on your mind, a little too often, we consider it spamming. Adimpression clearly deviates
            from that. Each product/service of Adimpression focuses on catering </p>

            <p>to our grand users. Adimpression does so,
                with advertisements, only when relevant, and in most occasions, when needed. Even the real social
                network
                "Down Town" adheres to this principle. Ideally, you would see many services offered at Down Town
                are
                most relevant. A service becomes an advertisement, if it is served when not relevant. An advertisement
                becomes a service, when provided at the exact time. Adimpression provides you with relevant services,
                just
                at that right time.

        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><p>Your data is located at The Rackspace Cloud (http://www.rackspacecloud.com/). How big is Rackspace?

        <li style="list-style-type:none;"><p><span style="color: #000000;">We hate crammed up lego box offices. We also hate to poop where we eat - in other words, that, would be, poluting the environment. Our office is located in a serene location of Sri Lanka, a beutiful Island in the indian ocean. You can come visit us there, but we've got nothing much to show of our own, except the heavenly scenery! Our office here, is only for the basic official and legal needs. Most of our employees work from home, adviced to take long vacations and are asked to be constantly happy(or else our products would fail in their core principles, wouldn't they?).
<br/>

<br/>
If you're going to pay us a visit, just let us know before hand. As we are still a startup, there's only so much we can be hospitable. So please bring your money with you :) And lets party!</span>

            yada yada.
