    <h1 class="intensity_1 bold big">Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        Below is the Privacy Policy of iLikePlaces.com. Please read it carefully. It is written as simple as possible so
        that
        you actually READ it.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        1. What DEFINITE information does iLikePlaces.com collect from me? Your valid email ID and password.

        The remaining information can be given as false or left blank by you. If you very concerned of privacy,
        iLikePlaces.com
        encourages you to do so.
        Your email ID WILL be stored almost permanently at iLikePlaces.com. Your password WILL NOT be stored at
        iLikePlaces.com,
        except until the few seconds span during which you enter the password to login(e.g Similar to an unsaved text
        document.
        If you turn off your PC without saving, it is gone forever. iLikePlaces.com uses the BlowFish Algorithm.).

        When you get an account activation URL, you will see that it contains a "$2a$" prefix. The text following this
        would
        be
        what we store of your password. This is OpenBSD's BlowFish implementation as bcrypt algorithm. For more
        information,
        look here: http://www.openbsd.org/papers/bcrypt-paper.pdf .

        It is common to use simple guessable passwords on websites. We've made it almost impossible for hackers(or would
        take
        millions of years with the fastest super computer) to guess your password even though it is simple, by looking
        at
        what
        "we store" of your password on our side. However, we cannot protect you from wild guesses or sharp hackers who
        know
        you
        always use your doggy's name for your password.

        Please note that iLikePlaces.com IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR INFORMATION LEAKED DURING NETWORK TRANSMISSION OF DATA.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        2. Why does iLikePlaces.com collect the information in Point 1?

        iLikePlaces.com collects your email ID to log you in to, to give you an identity and to prevent others from
        performing
        actions only you are authorized to do within, the website. This information iLikePlaces.com stores.

        iLikePlaces.com collects your password to log you in to the website. This information iLikePlaces.com DOES NOT
        store.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        3. Can I COMPLETELY remove all involvements with iLikePlaces.com? Perhaps, and this feature is not currently
        implemented.

        Yes "perhaps". iLikePlaces.com has to be clear on this. In iLikePlaces.com you might do a lot of things
        interacting
        with
        people.

        There are two categories of information you should be concerned here - Personal Information, and Information You
        actually "Give People".

        Personal Information can be COMPLETELY deleted such as email ID and password.

        Once these are deleted, you are "dead" to the website.

        Information You Give People, such as COMMENTS and friendship CONNECTIONS, might and most probably WILL leave
        traces
        behind once you delete an account. Think of it this way: You cannot precisely undo something that really
        happened,
        in
        real world or in iLikePlaces.com.

        The best example we can give would be, if Mike is a friend of Stacy, Stacy can "copy and paste" Mikes
        information
        while
        they are friends at iLikePlaces.com. When Mike deletes his account, Stacy would still have the information as
        she
        copied
        it. This sort of information, iLikePlaces.com tries but cannot guarantee to delete when deleting your account.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        5. Will you change this privacy policy? Yes, iLikePlaces.com holds the right to do so WITHOUT INFORMING YOU. So
        if
        you
        are are really keen on keeping up, please check here frequently.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        6. Can I contact iLikePlaces.com regarding this privacy policy? iLikePlaces.com has a huge user base, and
        therefore,
        you
        cannot contact iLikePlaces.com regarding this. You can however, REFUSE TO AGREE to this policy.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        7. Do I need to worry about privacy? YES. You could always provide the DEFINITE information accurately with
        iLikePlaces.com and keep the rest of the information false or empty.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        8. How safe is this privacy policy? iLikePlaces.com's privacy policy is very open and precise about your
        privacy. It
        is
        your own decision to decide if it is safe and to agree or not agree to it. We do not want to mislead you on this
        matter.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        9. How hacker safe, is my information? Sorry, with this regard iLikePlaces.com cannot guarantee 100% safety.

        BUT, iLikePlaces.com does point out to you that, iLikePlaces.com provides a way around this. You can always use
        your
        nickname which only your friends know, as your first name and leave the second name blank.

        If you do not have a nickname, AFTER adding your friends, change your name to a new nickname.

        While this keeps your information safe, you also help yourself in adhering to the core iLikePlaces.com values
        i.e.
        to
        socialize in the real world. This means, you ADD ONLY FRIENDS YOU SOCIALIZE WITH(to whom you can tell your
        nickname),
        not the entire unwanted lot.

        iLikePlaces.com resides in very secure environments of operation to ensure hackers don't gain access to
        privileged
        information.
    </p>

    <p class="intensity_2">
        10. Is iLikePlaces.com "emotional privacy" safe? Yes.

        Emotional privacy(a term we coined up) is where you have protection from your emotional status information with
        people.
        Usually, you would want to say something such as you are "depressed" only to people close to you. Maybe, even
        letting
        your closest people know this, is not actually your wish and would make you look silly. While a social network
        can
        violate this by its "design", exposing your STATUS to every body who knows (and possibly does not know) you,
        iLikePlaces.com is designed to protect you from this.

        One way iLikePlaces.com does this is, iLikePlaces.com encourages and helps you add only close friends as
        friends.

        As iLikePlaces.com encourages that you visit iLikePlaces.com ONLY when you have no way of socializing in "real
        world"
        AND to find a way of socializing in "real world", chances are, you are well off without letting your emotional
        privacy
        being violated.

        In fact, if your employers or employees checks your iLikePlaces.com profile and comments, this would mean there
        is a
        good chance they do NOT find out about those problems you faced during the past ten years, which you did not
        want
        them
        to hear about.

        This document only focuses on your DIRECT information and engagement with iLikePlaces.com. Any 3rd parties
        rendered
        involved by you or iLikePlaces.com will be binding you or iLikePlaces.com with the 3rd party, separately. Hence,
        iLikePlaces.com shall not be made bound by legalities, under any circumstance, directly relating you and
        iLikePlaces.com
        or you and the 3rd party, with regard to a 3rd party involvement, unless otherwise properly enforced by law.

        As iLikePlaces.com is a innovative service we offer mostly free of charge, by using iLikePlaces.com you agree
        not to
        legally bind us with anything with regard to your or anybody's interaction with iLikePlaces.com.

        This document claims to be addressed to the general public, not just lawyers, and so the norms, conventions, and
        standards of ordinary people are what the text must be judged by - not the stricter, but slippery language that
        is
        legally correct.
