These often stem from a lack of appreciation of the advance, or &#x201c;lead&#x201d;, time required and the amount of cooperative effort needed to pull off an event which makes sailors want to come back again and again. To do a good job, start the planning early and make sure the burdens are shared.&#xa;&#xa;  The 2001-2004 edition of US SAILING&#x2019;s Race Management Handbook includes the recommended basic outline of a timetable below (used with permission and noted for conditions specific to the SAIL region):&#xa;&#xa; 12 months in advance:&#xa;&#xa;Pick regatta dates. {SAIL&#x2019;s general meeting is held the first Saturday of November and it&#x2019;s an excellent idea to send a club representative to that meeting to present your preferred dates to avoid conflict with another club&#x2019;s event.}&#xa;&#xa;Select Steering Committee.&#xa;&#xa; Determine advertising category of each class.&#xa;&#xa;9 months:&#xa;&#xa;Select key members of regatta committee &amp; conduct first of monthly meetings.&#xa;&#xa;Complete preliminary detailed budget.&#xa;&#xa; Confirm major sponsorships, if any.&#xa;&#xa;6 months:  &#xa;&#xa;Confirm major project assignments.&#xa;&#xa; Publish Notice of Race for major events. (Smaller events, publish at 3 months.) on website. {SAIL will publish your NOR on its website if you submit it and also in quarterly newsletter if received 10 days in advance of publication dates -- i.e. by Dec. 20, Mar. 20, Jun. 20, Sept. 20.}&#xa;&#xa; 3 months:&#xa;&#xa;Complete competitor advance registration packets.&#xa;&#xa;Publish Notice of Race if not done before.&#xa;&#xa;Issue initial publicity. (Press releases, mailings to potential competitors.)&#xa;&#xa;Complete intiial grounds plan, social plan, housing plan &amp; ceremonies plan.&#xa;&#xa;Order all necessary outside equipment.&#xa;&#xa; Submit permit application (if not done before.)&#xa;&#xa;2 months:&#xa;&#xa;Finalize housing, dinner, trophies, entertainment reservations &amp; orders.&#xa;&#xa; Formally invite dignitaries.&#xa;&#xa;1 month:&#xa;&#xa;Print final Sailing Instructions &amp; put on website.&#xa;&#xa;Entry deadline for major regattas.&#xa;&#xa;Confirm personnel schedule.&#xa;&#xa;Confirm all equipment. {Check locations of fixed marks.. Sufficient depth for multi-boat roundings? Easily distinguishable from navigation buoys?}&#xa;&#xa;Confirm borrowed or chartered boats.&#xa;&#xa;Confirm final social, grounds, housing, &amp; ceremonial plans.&#xa;&#xa; Initiate media contact for TV, radio, newspapers. (Earlier for magazines.)&#xa;&#xa;1 week:&#xa;&#xa;Final regatta committee meeting.&#xa;&#xa;All printed material to regatta office.&#xa;&#xa;All on-site &#x201c;look&#x201d; materials ready for display.&#xa;&#xa;Set up venue.&#xa;&#xa;Confirm receipt of prizes.&#xa;&#xa;Send updated publicity to media.&#xa;&#xa; For handicap regattas, prepare class or division breaks by ratings and prepare final scratch sheets and list of competitors by rating. {Difficult when competitors sign up on race day. Try making scratch sheets from prior year entries,, then line out those that don&#x2019;t enter.}&#xa;&#xa;Race Day 1:&#xa;&#xa;Race committee organizational meeting.&#xa;&#xa;Race committee/protest committee/organizing authority joint organizational meeting.&#xa;&#xa;Competitors&#x2019; meeting.&#xa;&#xa;Go out on the water &amp; start racing.&#xa;&#xa;In our region, little sailing can be done during the winter months, so this season presents a good time for getting the preparation work done. Adaptations and adjustments  to the timetable will be needed for local conditions and situations. For example, there may be other tasks you&#x2019;ll need to add. But, don&#x2019;t ignore the need to plan and organize in advance.&#xa;&#xa;On delegation: It requires that the delegator receive frequent and periodic reports to assure that the delegee is on schedule. Don&#x2019;t assume; you&#x2019;ll be unpleasantly surprised.&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;source~http://www.rmsail.org/Race_Mgt/Regatta-Planning.htm"/>

A bachelor party is an important rite of passage into married life, and you want the one you plan to go down in the history books. Just follow this step-by-step guide to ensure that the fellas will have a night to remember&#x2014;without putting the wedding in jeopardy.&#xa;Step 1: Set the Date&#xa;&#xa;Although bachelor parties have been known to take place the night before the wedding, it is a much better idea to celebrate several days or even weeks prior to the big day. After all, no one wants last-minute details or pre-wedding jitters to ruin the festivities&#x2014;or a wicked hangover to rain on the wedding-day parade.&#xa;Check with the groom to find out what days are most convenient for the event, and then make sure the majority of the wedding party (especially close relatives and best friends) will be able to attend.&#xa;Keep in mind that out-of-town guests might not be arriving until a few days before the ceremony.&#xa;If the bachelor party will take place over several days or nights, try to schedule it on a weekend (so guests won&apos;t have to miss work), and check airfare and hotel rates and availability if necessary.&#xa;Step 2: Consider Your Budget&#xa;&#xa;Sometimes the best man fronts the bill for the event, but often party-goers are expected to chip in. Planning an expensive bash can be a financial strain on the guests, and will most likely result in your getting a lot of dirty looks during the ceremony. If your heart&apos;s set on a penthouse suite on the Vegas strip, make absolutely sure all the guys are willing to fork over their fair share before you commit.&#xa;Ask the groom&apos;s family and friends about how much money they are willing to spend on the party.&#xa;Make a list of all possible expenses, including transportation, food, drinks, activities, and tips.&#xa;This should give you an idea of what kind of party activities are possible. Plan the event according to this budget.&#xa;Inform each guest of what his expected cost will be, and make sure everyone is okay with it.&#xa;Step 3: Build a Guest List&#xa;&#xa;Now that you&apos;ve decided when and what kind of activities will take place, it&apos;s time to plan your guest list. A party is only as fun as those in attendance, so try to compile a friendly and entertaining group.&#xa;Ask the groom for his ideal guest list.&#xa;Ask close friends and family who else should be invited.&#xa;Consider inviting the groom&apos;s childhood friends, out-of-town relatives, or favorite coworkers.&#xa;Make sure there are no bad feelings between guys on the guest list, and that everyone will be able to get along.&#xa;Consider your activity: certain activities are better suited to a small group, while others are more fun with more people.&#xa;Consider your budget.&#xa;If necessary, remove guests from list.&#xa;Have the groom approve the finalized guest list and make sure no one is missing.&#xa;Step 4: Send Invitations&#xa;&#xa;Mail invitations to the bachelor party several months in advance, so that out-of-towners can make necessary arrangements. In the weeks before the event, you can also send out paper or electronic save-the-date cards as an added reminder. The invitations should include the following details:&#xa;Name of the bachelor&#xa;The announcement of his wedding and the name of the bride&#xa;Date and time of party&#xa;Location of party&#xa;Contact name and phone number&#xa;RSVP date&#xa;Any other important notes (what to wear, what to bring, etc.)&#xa;Step 5: Choose a Theme&#xa;&#xa;The most important thing to consider here is the interests and personality of the groom-to-be. Know your groom and plan accordingly. That being said, there is a bachelor party out there for everyone, and often the most creative ideas are the most memorable.&#xa;For the Sports Addict: A night of foam fingers and overpriced hot dogs is always a great male-bonding activity. Snag tickets to see his favorite baseball, basketball, football, or hockey team in action, and arrange for a &quot;Jim&apos;s Getting Married!&quot; message to pop up on the Jumbo Tron. Or for more hands-on fun, split the wedding party into teams and organize a game of soccer or beach volleyball.&#xa;For the Thrill Seeker: An outrageous bachelor party gives everyone an unforgettable experience&#x2014;and ensures that you will be forever honored for your creative party-planning skills. Don&apos;t forget proper instruction, proper equipment, and/or life vests (safety first!). A few ideas:&#xa;Bungee jumping&#xa;Skydiving&#xa;Parasailing&#xa;Waterskiing&#xa;White-water rafting&#xa;For the Nature Lover: Venturing into the great outdoors makes for a much-needed escape from reality, and an excuse to indulge in a little primitive male behavior (spitting contests, anyone?). Organize for the gang to go hiking, camping, skiing, or fishing. Stuff backpacks with any necessary supplies (map, water bottles, lighter, sleeping bags) and guy-friendly grub that his fianc&#xe9;e will probably be happy to miss out on. Finish off the trip with a campfire and embarrassing college that final farewell to the single life. Make sure to stuff backpacks with any necessary supplies:&#xa;Map&#xa;Lighter&#xa;Sleeping bags&#xa;Water bottles&#xa;Sunscreen&#xa;For the Die-Hard Partier: Bar-hop at local favorites, or pick a party-friendly destination (Vegas, Miami, New York, and Mexico come to mind). If you&apos;re staying close to home, make sure to arrange for a cab, party bus, or sober driver for transport to and from the bars. Make sure everyone has cash and their ID, and never let the groom pay for his own drinks.&#xa;For the Homebody: Some bachelors couldn&apos;t care less about having a crazy party, but his buddies can still honor the big day with more relaxed activities. Some laid-back options include:&#xa;Beach barbecue&#xa;Amusement park&#xa;Mini-golfing&#xa;Poker night&#xa;To Hire Strippers or Not to Hire Strippers?&#xa;&#xa;Raunchy teen movies lead one to believe that bachelor parties aren&apos;t complete without a stripper, but that just isn&apos;t true anymore. Many guys are not comfortable with the idea, and oftentimes grooms want to spare themselves the embarrassment&#x2014;and the inevitable wrath of the bride. Before you dial Strippers R Us, think long and hard about whether your guests will really appreciate a strange woman performing lewd acts in a groomsman&apos;s living room. If you do decide to go ahead with it, make sure the company is reputable and ask for references before booking. For visual stimulation that requires less planning, opt for a night out at a strip club instead.&#xa;Step 6: Book the Venue&#xa;&#xa;For the Sports Addict: Book tickets to the big game online. Make sure all the guests are seated together. For large parties, it&apos;s often more efficient to call the stadium or arena to make sure there are enough tickets available in a desirable section.&#xa;For the Thrill Seeker: Think about what adventures are possible in your area.&#xa;Some activities, like parasailing and bungee jumping, are doable in many locations and can be booked online or by phone.&#xa;Others, like water-skiing and white-water rafting, require a large body of water nearby. In this case, look up water-sporting opportunities by your nearest river or lake.&#xa;For the Nature Lover: Find the state or national park nearest you, and print out a map of popular trails and camping grounds. There is usually no need to book a reservation, but call the park&apos;s info center with any questions.&#xa;For the Die-Hard Partier: For bar-hopping with a smaller group (ten or less), you probably don&apos;t need to confirm with the locations. Larger parties require a bit more planning.&#xa;When choosing a venue, find out which nightspots were voted the best in your city.&#xa;If you&apos;d like to book a table or reserve bottle service, call and make a reservation (bars and clubs often get very crowded).&#xa;For a destination party, book airplane tickets and hotels well in advance in order to get the best deals.&#xa;For the Homebody: This one is a piece of cake! Beaches, amusement parks, and mini-golfing places do not require advanced booking. If anything, check the weather forecast to ensure that your outdoor fun won&apos;t be spoiled by clouds or rain. If you&apos;re hosting a poker or movie night, make your plans known to any others who live with you (and maybe ask them politely to be out of the house that night).&#xa;Step 7: Food and Drinks&#xa;&#xa;For the Sports Addict: Chow down on typical ballpark grub (sure to be ridiculously overpriced, of course).&#xa;Hot dogs&#xa;French fries&#xa;Pizza&#xa;Peanuts&#xa;Soda&#xa;Beer&#xa;For the Thrill Seeker: Keep energy levels high with healthy foods rich in protein and carbohydrates, and make sure to guzzle water&#x2014;all that activity might leave the guys dehydrated.&#xa;Nuts&#xa;Fruit&#xa;Sandwiches&#xa;All-natural protein bars&#xa;For the Nature Lover: Just because the bachelor party is out in the wilderness doesn&apos;t mean you have to live off the land: just choose dishes that don&apos;t require a lot of preparation. If you plan on bringing a grill or cooking on a campfire, look up recipes suited to your style of cooking. Some tasty options:&#xa;Canned beans&#xa;Beef jerky&#xa;Baked potatoes&#xa;Pasta salad&#xa;For the Die-Hard Partier: Start the bachelor off with a wacky-sounding cocktail like a Hurricane or a Dirty Banana, then order a round of appetizers from the bar menu. And make sure to keep an eye on the alcohol intake of the guests&#x2014;nothing ruins a party like a drunk buddy shouting, stumbling, or causing trouble.&#xa;Mini pizzas&#xa;Chicken fingers&#xa;Nachos&#xa;Chips and salsa&#xa;For the Homebody: Before hitting the beach or roller coasters, stop by the groom&apos;s favorite local sandwich shop for a hearty sub and a refreshing lemonade. If you&apos;re staying in, order pizzas and stock up on plenty of snacks. Hey, all that poker-playing can work up an appetite!&#xa;Cookies&#xa;Chips and homemade guacamole&#xa;Trail mix&#xa;Step 8: Executing the Party Plan&#xa;&#xa;During the Party&#xa;&#xa;Introduce guests.&#xa;&#xa;Take any gifts and set them aside.&#xa;&#xa;Make sure everyone gets to and from the destination on time.&#xa;&#xa;Make sure all bills are paid, and that drivers, waiters, and bartenders are tipped.&#xa;&#xa;Regulate if any guests start getting too drunk or out of hand.&#xa;&#xa;Check in with the groom periodically to make sure he is having fun.&#xa;&#xa;Take pictures.&#xa;&#xa;The Week Before the Party&#xa;&#xa;Confirm all reservations (events tickets, restaurants, hotels).&#xa;&#xa;Check out the venue to make sure everything is in order.&#xa;&#xa;Organize transportation to and from the venue. Recruit pals to drive, or make plans to get there by limo or taxi.&#xa;&#xa;Purchase party supplies: snack foods and drinks, disposable cameras, and sunscreen for outdoor activities.&#xa;&#xa;Field any questions from guests.&#xa;&#xa;Make sure the groom is happy with all of the party plans, and make any changes if necessary.&#xa;&#xa;After the Party&#xa;&#xa;Make sure guests get home safely.&#xa;&#xa;Clean up, if necessary.&#xa;&#xa;Make sure all the gifts get to the bachelor.&#xa;&#xa;Develop pictures and put them in a scrapbook. Present it to the groom after the wedding day.&#xa;&#xa;Resources for How to Plan a Bachelor Party&#xa;&#xa;About.com: Bachelor Party Ideas&#xa;&#xa;About.com: Ideas for Throwing a Bachelor or Bachelorette Party&#xa;&#xa;Evite.com: Bachelor Party Ideas&#xa;&#xa;LovetoKnow.com: Bachelor Party Ideas&#xa;&#xa;Party411.com: Bachelor/Bachelorette Party Planning Guide&#xa;&#xa;Suite 101: Alternative Bachelor Party Ideas&#xa;&#xa;"/>

Whether it&#x2019;s your first time preparing the feast or your umpteenth time, successful Thanksgiving dinners happen thanks to preparedness and organization. With Thanksgiving being a little less than a week away, now is as good of a time as any to begin planning for the big meal.&#xa;Plan the Menu&#xa;The most important part to preparing the feast is to know exactly what ingredients you need and making sure you have them on hand on the big day. Peruse cookbooks, jot down recipes, take inventory of what you have in your kitchen, make a list of the needed ingredients and head to the grocery store to buy all of the necessary ingredients.&#xa;Thaw the Turkey&#xa;What is the one dish that needs a lot of prep before it is showcased on the dining room table? The bird, of course. Since most people tend to buy frozen turkeys, it&#x2019;s never a good idea to run to the store the day before Thanksgiving, buy a frozen turkey and throw it in the oven the next day. Frozen turkeys need time to thaw and this thawing process can take up to a few days. Once you are ready to begin thawing the turkey, take the bird out of the freezer and place in a pan, keeping the packaging wrap in place. Leave the bird in the refrigerator for approximately 24 hours for every 5 pound of turkey.&#xa;Prepare Ahead of Time&#xa;Thanksgiving is supposed to be all about spending time with family and friends; however, many of us end up spending the entire day in the kitchen. Almost all of the side dishes and desserts can be prepared the day before Thanksgiving. Be sure to get all of the baking out of the way and prepare casseroles and store them in the refrigerator until the day of Thanksgiving.&#xa;Create a Schedule&#xa;On the day of Thanksgiving, it&#x2019;s important to know the cook times of each dish so that all of the dishes can be served fresh and warm. By creating a cook schedule, you&#x2019;ll know exactly what is supposed to go into the oven and how much time it will take to cook. There is only so much space in an oven which is why it&#x2019;s important to plan this schedule so that everything arrives to the table warm and ready to eat.&#xa;Enjoy the Feast&#xa;The theme of the day is enjoying time with family and friends and to express thankfulness and gratitude. By following these tips, you&#x2019;ll be able to enjoy stress-free time in "/>

This occurs throughout the human life cycle (Schaefer &amp; Lamm, 1992: 113). Resocialization can be an intense experience, with the individual experiencing a sharp break with their past, and needing to learn and be exposed to radically different norms and values. An example might be the experience of a young man or woman leaving home to join the military, or a religious convert internalizing the beliefs and rituals of a new faith. An extreme example would be the process by which a transsexual learns to function socially in a dramatically altered gender role."/>
