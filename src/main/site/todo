0. File Uploading Java
4. FRIENDS TABLE AND EXTRACTION
5. ADD DATABASE NON AVAILABILITY EXCEPTION WRAPPER.
6. GENDER BASED PROFILES (INCLUDE GENDER NEUTRAL)
7. DATABASE POLLING FOR GROUP MESSAGES.
8. Customers are starting to expect the companies they do business with to use these tools and communities.
    If I have a problem with a product and I blog or Tweet about it,
    it's really nice when the company shows up and helps me. The expectation of many consumers is that their technology
    or media companies will use social media. The expectation for, say, financial services companies, is lower
    (except for Wells Fargo, which happens to use Twitter).
9. How do you look if you don't have a presence on Facebook? Customers are saying,
    This is where I live, where I want to have a dialogue, and if you don't want to engage with me here,
    you probably don't want my business.
10. fix location enum which is A BUG!!!
11. Randomize non ranked photos
12. Share Widget
13. Feminine Factor
14. Remind other friend

MARKETTING

Its FREE, but ummmm....

Okay, let us be honest.

We wanted to build you a good social network on the internet but,
We simply couldn't do that to you. Meeting people online? Duh, get a life!
Instead, we decided to do the right thing,
get you socialized "on the internet" AND "the real world"!
And that's why you are at iLikePlaces.com
to be known, to earn your worth, and to socialize both on net and off net!
to have fun and to socialize!

Be it a trip, family reunion, hanging out with bros, or just the annual event of
your company, we do it on net, and we do it off net, and we do it right here, at
iLikePlaces.com. Because we do it right!


Now pick a good username:(eg:northem.whites) [         ]

and a GOOD password (eg:7o7eye.The.5ai1or) [           ]

then click here and we are done!

Ah, finally, why the name iLikePlaces?
Gathering is the nature of us humans. And we gather at places we like!
Lets do this!

10. Friends
===========

10.00. Identity

        GOTO 10.30

        Profile Photo

10.05. Find Friends(CRITICAL)

            Name
            Age || Age Range
            Location || Super Location
            OP School && || OP University

            This means, when subscribing, you also take Location. This is a good
            way to populate the database! Initially, it is best to go by
            existing locations (Country will be there anyway).

10.10. Friend Communication - Inbox Outbox

            Since group messages are based on polling, make general messages the
            same too.

10.40.00. Oblige list (People whom a user asked favors from and what they were)

10.40.10. I don't know how to use this. Pleas help me.

10.50. During signup, use the localized data.

10.50.10. Check the localized userbase. Handle more and less scenarios.
            If there are a lot of users, then tell the user he is late, help him
            find his/her friends, and help him/her gain some recognition.
            If there are only a few, use the "be the first" approach. e.g. be
            the first to tell your friends about this. (they follow you).

10.60. Follower competition. Who has more gets followed by the friend who has
        less.
