This document ranks this software itself by standards it chooses to use.
These standards are given below.
Before each release, please check whether they hold good.

1. Simplicity. Users navigation and usage of software, should be made to do as fewer mistakes as possible.

This is for, clicks, and other user interface operations.
You should try to make the software behave and perform heuristics in exact expectation.

2. Does each component clearly state what it does?

For example, a widget says "This is a trip planner", and should not say "Event Planner".
Try to break down the users operations into a few steps if you need to simplify the messages.

3. Is the business model clearly active on the interface/widget? Does it speak for itself?

4. How does the interface promote Seek mode or Retention?

5. Does the interface promote user tolerance? Give tolerance to take.

For example, if the user enters june 21st instead of june 21, is this tolerated?
If this cannot be done, then users will drop out of your site at strange locations.
If the software does not tolerate, the user will not tolerate.

6. In validation, if validation fails, give a clear example of the proper format.


7. Avoid branching navigation and promote unit interfaces.

8. Does the URL act as a breadcrumb.

9. Does the search result in sane links?

10. Does a search or navigation maximise the users probabity to find what he wants without confusion?

11. Are your searches case insensitive? Did you inform the user this?
