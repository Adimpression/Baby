Goal of this document:

To provide a good understanding of what ilp is and how it would evolve. This
includes both engineering and business details.

What is ilp?

I Like Places is a website through which, people can do "basically" the
following

1. Explore and have fun in places by discovering, gathering and organizing
events in such places.

Discovery can be though Google, referals(e.g. friend suggest) or
or research (e.g. I live in Colombo, so I visit a sub location of it which is
the Dehiwala Zoo).

Gathering is the process of getting together the human resources. Users might
have to be invited on the event or be even an existing group, like high school
class 2004

Organizing events is where the site suggests hotels, flights and other resources
needed for this place. 

See? thats pretty much it. The rest grows on this!
