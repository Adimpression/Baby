This oath is for anybody working in the IT field.
Advice is to read it before you start work.
Some of these are derivations of TPS.

1. I will work in simple granular tasks and pre/post document them.
2. I will not move or switch to a new task unless a small granular task is well complete.
3. I will start from abstract levels of a task, first finishing off abstractions.
4. I will get the abstract system running which is the #1 goal. Others come after.
5. I will try my best to postpone a task and take up a rebounding task.
6. I will completely set aside bugs and huge issues to sort themselves out by next visit.
7. I will not do any work that does not make something "very" clearly easy, productive and profitable.
8. I will prepare a "process" for every repetitive task and document it.

And finally,

I love my users and I will always love them.
