The intention of this document is to provide some assitance with web designing in relation to ilikeplaces.

This document will containt some specific paths to be taken, and some valuable design advice.

Please make sure that you clarify all doubts when designing something. While software are things that do something, it is the designer that actually "communicates" to the user. Communication is the key factor in any business. This is why though Linux based dirstros might be much better than Windows, windows is still used widely. This is why, simpler applications are chosen against much complicated ones. Therefore, as with any software, web applications have web designers at the key position of making things profitable. 

So, to get started,

The first thing we look for is flexibility. Room for change is a "must. Therefore, we have some simple things we do.

1. Never use the "style" attribute in elements, and always use classes instead.
2. Use a css based framework. If you don't like what is out there, make your own. But then it should be better than the rest.
3. Learn Fitts Law. This is a visual representation. http://particletree.com/features/visualizing-fittss-law/  and if you have time, read its opposite http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/03/the-opposite-of-fitts-law.html
