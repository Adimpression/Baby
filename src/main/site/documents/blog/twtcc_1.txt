He starts with how to find the best suited solution to a problem. A design pattern.
He realises, it is not the architecture. Things change. Its the problem stupid!
Htakes some time off, to note down the "stuff" associated with the problem.
"Hmmmm..." then he thinks... "these things need a model of some kind"....
and then he designs an clear model of the things involved in the problem.
It was a long time since he realized, people are lazy. Lazy to adapt too.
Given a solution to a problem, if its' stuff needs adapting, it is unlikely to be useful.
He says, "I will make a concrete model of stuff based on the problem".

Easiest for the problem. Not for the architect.

Now the entities involved in the problem are modelled.
Their interaction with the core system is designed. A lazy way.

Now that the baby monsters are dealt with, he can meet the monster mommy.
The problem.
