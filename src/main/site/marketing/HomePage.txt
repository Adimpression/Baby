I LIKE PLACES HOME PAGE RETENTION DISCUSSION.

WE INTEND TO CHECK THE POSSIBILITY OF RETAINING A USER AND SIGNING HIM UP.

FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF HOME PAGE:

1. NAME "DOWNTOWN"
2. SEARCH BOX AND SEARCH BUTTON
3. HOTSPOT HEATMAP

FUNDAMENTAL CONFUSIONS TO BE CLEARED:

1. WHAT IS DOWNTOWN?
2. WHAT DOES THE SEARCH BOX/BUTTON DO?
3. WHAT IS THE MAP ALL ABOUT?

FUNDAMENTAL MARKETING REQUIREMENTS:

1. WEBSITE PROVIDES A WAY TO FIND WAYS TO SOCIALIZE IN REAL LIFE


LET US JUST CLARIFY WHAT AN ADVERT/MARKETING APPROACH, IS ALL ABOUT. CLEARLY IT IS,

"SUCCESSFULLY CONVEYING THE FUNDAMENTAL MARKETING REQUIREMENT IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY"

SUCCESSFULLY = NOT MESSING UP WITH THE ORIGINAL MARKETING REQUIREMENT. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE AN ADVERT, USE THE ORIGINAL.
CONVEYING = SOMEHOW, THE MESSAGE SHOULD SINK IN TO THE RIGHT AUDIENCE.
EFFECTIVE = EFFECTIVE. SOME USE ATTRACTIVE STUFF LIKE BIKINI GIRLS. SOME JUST GO FOR THAT UN-FLUSHED TOILET.

NOW, LET'S MAKE A CALL. IF WE CAN'T MAKE THE HOME PAGE DO ITS ADVERT/MARKETING APPROACH, LETS JUST GIVE THE ORIGINAL.
WHY? WELL IT SEEMS CLEAR AND ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH. A GOOD IDEA PUT PLAIN IS GOOD ENOUGH.

"AT DOWNTOWN YOU CAN FIND WAYS TO SOCIALIZE IN REAL LIFE".

I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING BETTER THAN THAT. SO I GUESS WE'LL STICK TO THIS FOR "1.".



I THINK THE SOLUTION FOR "1" IS GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN WHAT "2" IS. SO I THINK WE SHOULD SETTLE FOR &crarr;
THE TERM FIND IMPLIES THE WAY TO GO IS TO FIND. AN EXAMPLE SEACH ENTRY IMPLIES A "PLACE" WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH.



THE MAP NEEDS A GOOD EXPLANATION ON WHAT A HOTSPOT IS.
THE MAP ALSO NEEDS TO SHOW A USE CAN MARK A NEW HOTSPOT.
