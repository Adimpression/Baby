Dear user,

Below is the Privacy Policy of iLikePlaces.com. Please read it carefully. It is written as simple as possible so that you actually READ it.

1. What DEFINITE information does iLikePlaces.com collects from me? ONLY your birthday, username and password.

The remaining information can be given as false or left blank by you. If you very concerned of privacy, iLikePlaces.com encourages you to do so.

2. Why does iLikePlaces.com collect the information in Point 1?

iLikePlaces.com collects your birthday because it is needed to filter any content based on any restrictions enforced by law. This information iLikePlaces.com stores.

iLikePlaces.com collects your username to log you in to, to give you an identity and to prevent others from performing actions only you are authorized to do within, the network. This information iLikePlaces.com stores.

iLikePlaces.com collects your password to log you in to the network. This information iLikePlaces.com DOES NOT store.

3. Can I COMPLETELY remove all involvements with iLikePlaces.com? Perhaps.

Yes "perhaps". iLikePlaces.com has to be clear on this. In iLikePlaces.com you might do a lot of things interacting with people.

There are two categories of information you should be concerned here - Personal Information, and Information You actually "Give People".

Personal Information can be COMPLETELY deleted such as username, password and birthday.

Once these are deleted, you are "dead" in the network.

Information You Give People, such as COMMENTS and friendship CONNECTIONS, might and most probably WILL leave traces behind once you delete an account. Think of it this way: You cannot precisely undo something that really happened, in real world or in iLikePlaces.com.

The best example we can give would be, if Mike is a friend of Stacy, Stacy can "copy and paste" Mikes information while he is at iLikePlaces.com. When Mike deletes his account, Stacy would still have the information. This sort of information, iLikePlaces.com tries but cannot guarantee to delete when deleting your account.

5. Will you change this privacy policy? iLikePlaces.com will only do so AFTER INFORMING YOU.

6. Can I contact iLikePlaces.com regarding this privacy policy? iLikePlaces.com has a huge user base, and therefore, you cannot contact iLikePlaces.com regarding this. You can however, REFUSE TO AGREE to this policy.

7. Do I need to worry about privacy? YES. You could always provide the DEFINITE information accurately with iLikePlaces.com and keep the rest of the information false or empty.

8. How safe is this privacy policy? iLikePlaces.com's privacy policy is very open and precise about your privacy. It is your own decision to decide if it is safe and to agree or not agree to it.

9. How hacker safe, is my information? Sorry, with this regard iLikePlaces.com cannot guarantee 100% safety.

BUT, iLikePlaces.com does point out to you that, iLikePlaces.com provides a way around this. You can always use your nickname which only your friends know, as your first name and leave the second name blank.

If you do not have a nickname, AFTER adding your friends, change your name to a new nickname.

While this keeps your information safe, you also help yourself in adhering to the core iLikePlaces.com values i.e. to socialize in the real world. This means, you add ONLY FRIENDS YOU SOCIALIZE with(to whom you can tell your nickname), not the entire unwanted lot.

10. Is iLikePlaces.com emotional privacy safe? Yes.

Emotional privacy is where you have protection from your emotional status information with people. Usually, you would want to say something such as you are "depressed" only to people close to you. Maybe, even letting your closest people know this, is not actually your wish. While a social network can violate this by its design, exposing your STATUS to every body who knows (and possibly does not know) you, iLikePlaces.com is designed to protect you from this.

One way iLikePlaces.com does this is,  iLikePlaces.com encourages and helps you add only close friends as friends.

As iLikePlaces.com encourages that you visit iLikePlaces.com ONLY when you have no way of socializing in "real world" AND to find a way of socializing in "real world", chances are, you are well off without letting your emotional privacy being violated.

In fact, if your employers or employees checks your iLikePlaces.com profile and comments, this would mean there is a good chance they do NOT find out about those problems you faced during the past ten years, which you did not want them to hear about.

This document claims to be addressed to the general public, not just lawyers, and so the norms, conventions, and standards of ordinary people are what the text must be judged by - not the stricter, but slippery language that is legally correct.
