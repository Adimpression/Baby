Download and extract TomEE
Upload ROOT.war
Copy JTA and NON_JTA data sources to tomee.xml in conf
Check if /tomee is protected in tomcat-users.xml in conf
Copy cloudfiles.properties and log4j.properties to lib
Run tests of TomEE
Move ROOT of TomEE to a backup
Copy favicon.ico webapps
Backup existing GlobalConfig.properties in previous TomEE/OpenEJB
copy derby client jar
delete seriializer and xercece both jars form ROOT/WI/
xerce and serializer will have to be deleted from project itself since TomEE keeps using them
all api keys need to be updated in Config.properties. Best is to use GlobalConfig, since that is what it was put in place for anyway
