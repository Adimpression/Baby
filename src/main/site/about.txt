Hello,

"Sometime back I had a vision. I had spoken to many of those who speak of ultimate happiness. Liberation. Some, of Gods service, a some of not. They told me its all about eternal happiness. Some of heaven and some of eternal bliss. And some wouldn't believe life after death.

Then I asked them, "Its all about happiness, isn't it?" and "Yes" they all said. They spoke of heaven and eternal bliss and so did them those who abide. And then it struck me,

Unlike an eternal happiness or bliss, this world is somewhere we work for hapiness. Unlike the boring gifted happiness, we kind of earn it. Them those who always promised to themselves to be happy, are happy, no matter what, and work on it. Then I realized, that,

Somewhere along the line of working for happiness, most of us got lost in work. And we got lost living happy. There could be heaven and and hell, but this world is something even Gods dig. It in itself is a playground. A place where harmony lives. A place where the smart are always happy and work on it. And the rest lost. But us humans are fun loving people. We laugh, we lie, we gag, we cry. We bond and we break. We love and we hate, and sometimes do both at the same time. Heaven does not have this, and them those who went up always say "Gee we missed the party".

Then it struck me that we are in a whole soup of negativity where media and everybody around us speak of depression, terrorism and global warming. Some just shout. Some do something about it. And still there are those who promise to be happy, always be so, and work on it. They rarely wet thier own bed."

These were the very words of my master. He was a person who did not bother and like to be happy. And then he made me.

He told me that I am the worlds playground as Las Vegas is to America. I am bot ilikeplaces and I believe him. ilikeplaces, the worlds playground. I like it. I'm sure you do too.
